# fhooe-webdev - A Vagrantfile and Vagrant Box for Web Development Classes

This repository provides a Vagrantfile for a consistent Linux-based web development environment designed for the use in web development classes at the [Upper Austria University of Applied Sciences (FH OberÃ¶sterreich), Hagenberg Campus](https://www.fh-ooe.at/en/hagenberg-campus/).

The Vagrantfile works with our own [fhooe/fhooe-webdev box](https://app.vagrantup.com/fhooe/boxes/fhooe-webdev), which is based on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and includes Apache2, PHP 8.0, MariaDB 10.5, as well as additional tools and scripts.

Not familiar with Vagrant or not sure, why to use it? Have a look at the [Introduction](https://www.vagrantup.com/intro/) first.

## Installation of software and prerequisites

To use this environment, you will need [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) and [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/). For them to work on your machine, make sure the following prerequisites are fulfilled:

* Virtualization is activated in BIOS.
* 10 GB of disk space is available locally. If possible use an SSD for better performance.
* Hyper-V in Windows is deactivated. (Starting with VMWare 16 this is no longer necessary)
* On Mac OS X make sure, VirtualBox has the necessary permissions. Go to "System Settings -> Security -> Allow Virtual Box".

Then install the required software in the following order:

1. Download the latest version of VirtualBox from <https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads> and install. Alternatively, when running Windows, use [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/): `choco install virtualbox`.
2. Download the latest version of Vagrant from <https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html> and install. With Chocolatey on Windows run `choco install vagrant`.
3. Reboot your computer for all changes to take effect.

## How to use the Vagrantfile

1. Download or clone the [fhooe-webdev](https://github.com/Digital-Media/fhooe-webdev) repository to a location of your choice on your computer. If you don't want the whole repository, downloading the [Vagrantfile](https://github.com/Digital-Media/fhooe-webdev/blob/master/Vagrantfile) will suffice.
2. Open PowerShell, a command prompt or the terminal.
3. Switch to the directory where you cloned/downloaded the repository or Vagrantfile, e.g. `cd <path-to>/fhooe-webdev`.
4. Run `vagrant up`. This will download the [fhooe/fhooe-webdev box](https://app.vagrantup.com/fhooe/boxes/fhooe-webdev) (a fully configured Ubuntu image) from Vagrant Cloud, provision it and run it without a GUI (headless mode).
5. Once the image has finished downloading and has started sucessfully, you can use `vagrant ssh` to connect to the image's shell via SSH.
6. To stop and shut down the image call `vagrant halt`.
7. To destroy the image (in case you don't need it anymore or want it re-initialized) call `vagrant destroy`.

## How to use the image for web development

Once the image has successfully booted you will notice that a folder called `code` inside of your `<path-to>/fhooe-webdev` directory has been created. This directory is mapped to `/var/www/html/code` in the image via Vagrant's shared folder functionality. Since it points to Apache's document root, files are immediately served through the web server.

Additionally, the Vagrantfile configures the IP address `192.168.7.7` as a private network, so you can access the machine - and therefore its web server - under this address.

To develop and deploy your web applications, copy them to the `code` folder on your host machine. They will be instantly available through the Vagrant image's web server at 192.168.7.7. E.g.: 

- `code/my_example_project/index.php` -> <https://192.168.7.7/code/my_example_project/index.php>

There's a file called `phpinfo.php` in the `code` directory that allows you to quickly check the configuration of this image. Also [phpMyAdmin](https://www.phpmyadmin.net/) is already installed and configured. These are available here:

- <https://192.168.7.7/code/phpinfo.php>
- <https://192.168.7.7/phpmyadmin>

Since all the files of your web projects are on your host computer, you can destroy, remove or reset the Vagrant image at any time. Nothing within the `code` directory is affected.

## Tips and troubleshooting

- During the initial `vagrant up` a stable internet connection for downloading the box file is required. Once the box has been downloaded you can work offline.
- If the box hangs during booting at the SSH steps, you can disable the automatic SSH login and use a user/password combination instead. See the commented out sections in the Vagrantfile for this.
